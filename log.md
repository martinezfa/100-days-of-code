**Today's Progress**: Completed the first lesson, basic html/html5. I learned some of the basic commands and which ones are self-closing (ex. img) and how to better organize and html page.

**Thoughts**: It was fun! Looking forward to learning about CSS tomorrow. 

### Day 2: December 15, 2020 

**Today's Progress**: Got excited and completed the second/third lessons (Basic CSS and Applied Visual Design). Learned some basic CSS commands and how to use @keyframes.
