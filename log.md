# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: December 13, 2020 

**Plans for the challenge**: Going to try to complete the Responsive Web Certification from Free Code Camp (https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn).

### Day 1: December 14, 2020 
##### First official Day

**Today's Progress**: Completed the first lesson, basic html/html5. I learned some of the basic commands and which ones are self-closing (ex. img) and how to better organize and html page.

**Thoughts**: It was fun! Looking forward to learning about CSS tomorrow. 

### Day 2: December 15, 2020 

**Today's Progress**: Got excited and completed the second/third lessons (Basic CSS and Applied Visual Design). Learned some basic CSS commands and how to use @keyframes. 

**Thoughts**: So far it's going pretty well. I'm still a little confused about cubic-bezier functions, but I get the general idea. Excited for Day 3!

### Day 3: December 16, 2020 

**Today's Progress**: Completed lessons 4, 5, and 6 (Applied Accessibility, Responsive Web Design Principles, and CSS Flexbox). Hoping to finish with the certification by this weekend!

**Thoughts**: It was really cool to learn more about how to make a webpage more accessible. Since I'm pretty new to HTML/CSS I did not know anything about the different accessibility options. An issue I've had in the past when trying to build my portfolio is trying to make it responsive, so this was a good introduction to that. 

### Day 4: December 17, 2020 

**Today's Progress**: Finished the remaining lesson (CSS grid) and am now working through the first project, designing a Tribute Page. I created the basic skeleton for what I want it the page to say/look like. I added extra colors right now so that I can better visualize the way my containers are working together. 

**Thoughts**: I'm having a lot of trouble in my tribute page making everything line up the way I want it to.

### Day 5: December 18, 2020 

**Today's Progress**: Finished the Tribute Page challenge (four challenges left). I learned how useful margins can be when trying to center something, that was a piece I was missing yesterday when trying to get the positions right. I think I got it to be pretty close to what they had. 

**Thoughts**: Still not super comfortable, but hopefully I'll get better over the next few challenges.

### Day 6: December 19, 2020 

**Today's Progress**: Finished the Survey Page challenge (three challenges left). Still had some difficulty being able to position my items in the center. Figured out that if I create a min size for the container that I'm using it will be easier to center. Also reviewed how to use radio buttons as well as checkboxes. Learned how to add drop-down select options. 

**Thoughts**: Not entirely comfortable with the positioning and everything, but I am getting better at it. Looking forward to tomorrow!

### Day 7: December 20, 2020 

**Today's Progress**: Finished the Product Landing Page challenge (two challenges left). Initially had difficulty remembering how to do the navigation bar, but eventually figured it out. Was happy with my ability to use flex in CSS. One thing that I did not do was add the images for the company logo and the little icons next to the product features. The page is not responsive so that's something to work on in the future. 

**Thoughts**: Need to do better with making things responsive. Looking forward to the next challenge tomorrow!

### Day 8: December 21, 2020 

**Today's Progress**: Worked on the fourth challenge, the technical documentation page. Haven't had much time today so was only able to put in exactly one hour, but got a fair amount done. I am up to the variables section, but don't know how to add code chunks in, so that's something to figure out tomorrow.

**Thoughts**: Starting to get the hang of things, I think!

### Day 9: December 22, 2020 

**Today's Progress**: Completed the fourth challenge. Figured out how to add the code chunks in for html

**Thoughts**: Having difficulty with making things responsive. Once I finish the project challenges I might watch some videos to see how other people would have completed the projects. Hopefully that will teach me how to make things more responsive and also show me different solutions.

### Day 10: December 23, 2020 

**Today's Progress**: Worked on the fifth and final challenge, the portfolio page. Have a very basic version of the html and css files.

**Thoughts**: Didn't have much time today, but hopefully tomorrow I can try and make some more progress.

### Day 11: December 25, 2020 

**Today's Progress**: Took yesterday (Christmas Eve) off, but finished the fifth and final challenge for the responsive web certification today. 

**Thoughts**: Could have tried to add a little more to it like hovering and still having some trouble with making things fully mobile responsive, but overall I'm happy with my progress!

### Day 12: December 26, 2020 

**Today's Progress**: Working on my own personal portfolio to later host on GitHub. 

**Thoughts**: Still struggling a little bit with the responsive parts, but I've gotten a lot better at using the containers and divs to my advantage.

### Day 13: December 27, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Still working on my personal portfolio. I finished a good computer-based version, but I'm still having difficulty making things responsive. I decided to start over and try the mobile-first approach since (from what I've read) that seems a little more difficult to start with but makes the transition easier.

**Thoughts**: Will keep working on this until I finish, but going to start the Python certifications tomorrow.

### Day 14: December 28, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Took a day off from my html/css personal portfolio and started the Scientific Computing with Python certification -- made it through 16/56 lessons. Also went back to practice some MatLab and made it through eight weeks of Coursera's nine week MatLab course. 

**Thoughts**: Will try to finish week nine of MatLab tomorrow and continue with some Python.

### Day 15: December 29, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Finished week nine of the MatLab Coursera course and received my certificate. Did not have the time to work on Python. Re-learned how to access content in a table (whether by curly brackets or parentheses) as well as elements within a cell. 

**Thoughts**: Looking forward to improving my coding skills with the Python course tomorrow. 

### Day 16: December 30, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Finished up and through "Dictionaries: Common Applications".

**Thoughts**: Kind of struggling with the idea of python dictionaries and how they work, so I will probably redo some of the lessons tomorrow. 

### Day 17: December 31, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Didn't have as much time today because of NYE, but I spent time trying to figure out how to create a hamburger menu for my personal portfolio.

**Thoughts**: I didn't make as much progress as I wanted to, but I'll be able to get a good amount done tomorrow, I hope! Plan for tomorrow is to do a little more work with the hamburger menu and keep going with the python for everybody lessons. I think I should be able to finish the certification by the end of the weekend.

### Day 18: January 1, 2021

**Today's Progress**:
