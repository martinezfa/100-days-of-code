# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: December 13, 2020 

**Plans for the challenge**: Going to try to complete the Responsive Web Certification from Free Code Camp (https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn).

### Day 1: December 14, 2020 
##### First official Day

**Today's Progress**: Completed the first lesson, basic html/html5. I learned some of the basic commands and which ones are self-closing (ex. img) and how to better organize and html page.

**Thoughts**: It was fun! Looking forward to learning about CSS tomorrow. 

### Day 2: December 15, 2020 

**Today's Progress**: Got excited and completed the second/third lessons (Basic CSS and Applied Visual Design). Learned some basic CSS commands and how to use @keyframes. 

**Thoughts**: So far it's going pretty well. I'm still a little confused about cubic-bezier functions, but I get the general idea. Excited for Day 3!

### Day 3: December 16, 2020 

**Today's Progress**: Completed lessons 4, 5, and 6 (Applied Accessibility, Responsive Web Design Principles, and CSS Flexbox). Hoping to finish with the certification by this weekend!

**Thoughts**: It was really cool to learn more about how to make a webpage more accessible. Since I'm pretty new to HTML/CSS I did not know anything about the different accessibility options. An issue I've had in the past when trying to build my portfolio is trying to make it responsive, so this was a good introduction to that. 

### Day 4: December 17, 2020 

**Today's Progress**: Finished the remaining lesson (CSS grid) and am now working through the first project, designing a Tribute Page. I created the basic skeleton for what I want it the page to say/look like. I added extra colors right now so that I can better visualize the way my containers are working together. 

**Thoughts**: I'm having a lot of trouble in my tribute page making everything line up the way I want it to.

### Day 5: December 18, 2020 

**Today's Progress**: Finished the Tribute Page challenge (four challenges left). I learned how useful margins can be when trying to center something, that was a piece I was missing yesterday when trying to get the positions right. I think I got it to be pretty close to what they had. 

**Thoughts**: Still not super comfortable, but hopefully I'll get better over the next few challenges.

### Day 6: December 19, 2020 

**Today's Progress**: Finished the Survey Page challenge (three challenges left). Still had some difficulty being able to position my items in the center. Figured out that if I create a min size for the container that I'm using it will be easier to center. Also reviewed how to use radio buttons as well as checkboxes. Learned how to add drop-down select options. 

**Thoughts**: Not entirely comfortable with the positioning and everything, but I am getting better at it. Looking forward to tomorrow!

### Day 7: December 20, 2020 

**Today's Progress**: Finished the Product Landing Page challenge (two challenges left). Initially had difficulty remembering how to do the navigation bar, but eventually figured it out. Was happy with my ability to use flex in CSS. One thing that I did not do was add the images for the company logo and the little icons next to the product features. The page is not responsive so that's something to work on in the future. 

**Thoughts**: Need to do better with making things responsive. Looking forward to the next challenge tomorrow!
