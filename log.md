# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: December 13, 2020 

**Plans for the challenge**: Going to try to complete the Responsive Web Certification from Free Code Camp (https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn).

### Day 1: December 14, 2020 
##### First official Day

**Today's Progress**: Completed the first lesson, basic html/html5. I learned some of the basic commands and which ones are self-closing (ex. img) and how to better organize and html page.

**Thoughts**: It was fun! Looking forward to learning about CSS tomorrow. 

### Day 2: December 15, 2020 

**Today's Progress**: Got excited and completed the second/third lessons (Basic CSS and Applied Visual Design). Learned some basic CSS commands and how to use @keyframes. 

**Thoughts**: So far it's going pretty well. I'm still a little confused about cubic-bezier functions, but I get the general idea. Excited for Day 3!

### Day 3: December 16, 2020 

**Today's Progress**: Completed lessons 4, 5, and 6 (Applied Accessibility, Responsive Web Design Principles, and CSS Flexbox). Hoping to finish with the certification by this weekend!

**Thoughts**: It was really cool to learn more about how to make a webpage more accessible. Since I'm pretty new to HTML/CSS I did not know anything about the different accessibility options. An issue I've had in the past when trying to build my portfolio is trying to make it responsive, so this was a good introduction to that.
